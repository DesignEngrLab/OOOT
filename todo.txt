1. add GPL license to all files
2. uniform output/verbosity print statements
	1 fn-eval/line = 5
	5 fn-eval/line = 4
    20 fn-eval/line = 3
    100 fn-eval/Line = 2
    400 fn-eval/line = 1
    2000 fn-eval/line = 0
3. ToKnownBest should there be one for f and one for x?
	also, should form be like % accuray instead of cutoff?
	(this would not need optimize-direction)
4. Generators
	a. need binary perturbation (for SA)
	b. differential evolution / real-valued crossover
	c. latin hyper cube
	d. alpha-ary crossover, and mutation
	e. to improve exhaustive and random HC, CreateNeighborChangeVectors() in 
	   designSpaceDescription could take a values to determine change-vectors
	   [a, b] where a in 1...n, being the number of dim's to simultaneously change
	   and b is the amount of change 1.....
	   is 3^n -1 = nC1 + nC2 + nC3 + ... + nCn?
5. finish SA with temperature schedules and test 
	test with StochasticNeighborGenerator
6. Debug DSCPowell
7. Debug SQP
8. finish GRG with slack
9. add PSO optimization method (can't simply be a generator - well. not sure.)
10. add comments
11. make test exe's
